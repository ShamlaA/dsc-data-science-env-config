00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,494
Hi, my name is Reindert-Jan Ekker, and

2
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:06,730
welcome to this course about data

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,259
manipulation with Pandas. Pandas is not

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,303
just one of the most popular software

5
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:15,607
packages for data analysis, it's also,

6
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:17,584
without a doubt, the most convenient and

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,414
fun way to work with your data. In this

8
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:22,794
course, I will cover the most important

9
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:24,778
core functionalities of Pandas, so that

10
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,102
after watching this course you will be

11
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:29,566
ready for just about any data wrangling

12
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:32,205
job that you might come across. In this

13
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:33,786
short introduction module, I'll tell you

14
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:35,871
what to expect from this course, what you

15
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,942
should already know, and I'll give you an

16
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:41,462
overview of the structure of the course.

17
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:45,988
So, this course focuses on core Pandas

18
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:48,816
functionality for data manipulation, and

19
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,746
we will look at that functionality in the

20
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,717
context of very common everyday tasks and

21
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:54,728
problems. Just about all of the

22
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:56,980
functionality we will explore is made

23
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,353
available through the two main Pandas

24
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:03,427
classes, the Pandas Series and the Pandas

25
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:05,084
DataFrame. There's also several things

26
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:07,173
that you will not find in this course.

27
00:01:07,173 --> 00:01:10,063
Fist of all, this is not a general Pandas

28
00:01:10,063 --> 00:01:11,951
introduction. I will assume a basic

29
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:14,459
knowledge of what a DataFrame and a Series

30
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,601
are. If you do not know the very basics,

31
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,517
there's a great intro course here on

32
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:21,221
Pluralsight that you may want to see

33
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:23,869
first. I'm not going to dive deeply into

34
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,485
data visualization because that's a

35
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,646
completely different topic from the core

36
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:29,987
data manipulation tasks I want to talk

37
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:32,689
about in this course. The same is true for

38
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:35,124
machine learning, or all the various ways

39
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:37,692
to do input and output with Pandas.

40
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:39,451
Furthermore, there are some Pandas

41
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:41,554
features that you may consider important,

42
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:44,307
or even core features, but that I have

43
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:47,065
chosen not to cover in this course because

44
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,483
in my opinion they are slightly too

45
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:52,943
involved. I'm talking about such things as

46
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:55,539
categoricals, advanced indexing, or time

47
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:59,649
series. So, what should you already know

48
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:02,972
before watching this? Well, of course, you

49
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:05,393
need some basic Python knowledge. At the

50
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:06,927
very least, you should have an

51
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,315
understanding of the built-in data

52
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:10,506
structures like lists and dicts, you

53
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,414
should be able to write functions, and you

54
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,565
should have a minimal understanding of

55
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:17,968
what classes and objects are. You should

56
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:20,716
also have at least a tiny bit of knowledge

57
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:22,333
of Pandas. Let's say you have played

58
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,147
around with it a little and you have an

59
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:26,774
understanding of what a Series, a

60
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:29,276
DataFrame, and an Index are. Finally,

61
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:31,459
there's the Jupyter Notebook, which is a

62
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,547
tool I will use to write and run my code.

63
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,380
You should have this installed and

64
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,341
running, and you should know how to work

65
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:41,996
with Notebook cells, write, edit, and run

66
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,039
code. Now in case this is new for you,

67
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,443
there's a Pluralsight intro course about

68
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:48,716
Jupyter as well. By the way, my tip to

69
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:51,506
you, install Anaconda from anaconda. org.

70
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:54,417
This will install Jupyter, NumPy, and

71
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:57,885
Pandas, as well as a wealth of other

72
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:00,441
popular packages for data science and

73
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:03,497
analysis. In a moment we'll start with the

74
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,583
next module called Exploring Data, and

75
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,251
it's about the first steps you take when

76
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:09,387
you start working with a new data set. How

77
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:11,848
much data do you have? What do the rows

78
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,266
and columns look like? We'll also do some

79
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,961
basic statistical exploration of our data.

80
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:20,910
Then we'll move on to a module called

81
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,730
Selecting, Filtering, and Sorting, and

82
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,809
this module focuses on getting information

83
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:27,153
out of your data set. Basically, it's

84
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:28,990
about asking the right questions and

85
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,730
drilling down into your data set. The

86
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,135
third module is about cleaning a data set.

87
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:37,760
Just about every real-world data set will

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,265
have some problems, and this can range

89
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:42,681
from missing data to unwanted data or

90
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,807
outliers, and we'll see various ways to

91
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,149
deal with those things. And the final

92
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:49,752
module is about transforming our data. So

93
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:52,111
here we'll see how to run Python functions

94
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:53,978
against our data, including functions we

95
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:56,273
write ourselves, using a very cool and

96
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:58,398
powerful feature called groupby, changing

97
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:01,982
the structure of our columns and rows and

98
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:04,416
combining multiple DataFrames into one.

99
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,789
Very well, that's it for this

100
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:12,000
introduction. Let's move on to the next module called Exploring data.
