00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,290
Hi, welcome to the last module of this

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,366
course, in which we'll see how to

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,916
transform our data into something

4
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:11,573
different. So you have a dataset, you've

5
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:14,436
cleaned it up, let's look at some things

6
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:17,881
we can do with our data. First of all,

7
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:20,376
let's do some calculations. We'll see how

8
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:22,947
to apply the basic math operators and how

9
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,816
to apply mathematical functions. We'll

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,139
also see how to define our own functions

11
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:31,828
and apply those to our data. After that,

12
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:34,800
we'll look at groupby, which is a very

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,774
powerful feature in Pandas that allows us

14
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:39,624
to split up our data into groups, apply

15
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:41,916
functions to those groups, and then

16
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,981
aggregate the results into a new

17
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,877
DataFrame. Now this might sound a little

18
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:48,068
bit abstract right now, but trust me, this

19
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:51,112
is a really powerful and cool feature in

20
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:53,182
Pandas. Then we'll move on to Pandas

21
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,167
operations that don't change the values of

22
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,529
your data, but the structure of your data.

23
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:59,706
A lot of the time when you receive a

24
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,497
dataset it doesn't have the structure you

25
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:03,821
want. In this part of the module, we'll

26
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:06,966
see several ways to restructure your data

27
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,043
either from rows to columns, or

28
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:15,000
vice-versa. Finally, we'll see several techniques to combine multiple datasets.
