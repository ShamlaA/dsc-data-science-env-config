00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,576
Hi, in this module we'll look at the first

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:06,148
steps for a data scientist when working

3
00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:08,493
with new datasets, exploring it to get a

4
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:12,448
feeling for the kind of data we have, the

5
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:15,335
statistical properties it has, and more.

6
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:18,276
Whenever you start to work with a new

7
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:20,743
dataset, the first thing you normally want

8
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:23,576
to do is to explore what the data looks

9
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:26,269
like. How many items are there in the set,

10
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:28,349
and what kind of measurements are there?

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,433
To get a feeling for the dataset, you

12
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:32,718
usually also want to see a quick overview

13
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:35,955
of basic statistics like the mean, max,

14
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:38,904
and minimum values, etc., etc., and maybe

15
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:41,453
even make a few simple plots while you're

16
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:44,098
at it. So this is exactly what I'll do in

17
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:49,000
this module. I'll show you how to get up and running with a new dataset.
