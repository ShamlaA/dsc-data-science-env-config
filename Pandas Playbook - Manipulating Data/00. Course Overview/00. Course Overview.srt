Hi everyone, my name is Reindert-Jan

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,483
Ekker, and welcome to this playbook about

3
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:12,424
manipulating data with Pandas. I'm a

4
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:13,981
senior developer and freelance educator,

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,619
and in this course I'll teach you about

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,706
Pandas, the most popular Python framework

7
00:00:18,706 --> 00:00:21,749
for doing data science and analysis. The

8
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:23,927
role of Pandas in data analysis has been

9
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:26,519
growing hard over the past few years, and

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,774
you simply cannot go without Pandas

11
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:30,800
anymore. This course goes over the core

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,057
tasks that you will need to perform when

13
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:35,050
working with any real-world dataset, and

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,976
we'll do so in a very hands-on way. Some

15
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:40,128
of the major topics that we will cover

16
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:41,545
include exploring a new dataset;

17
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:43,252
selecting, sorting, and filtering your

18
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,857
data so that you can drill down into your

19
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:49,229
dataset to answer specific questions;

20
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:51,106
cleaning a dataset, which means doing

21
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:53,675
things like fixing bad or missing data

22
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:56,184
points and removing outliers; and

23
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:58,816
transforming your data either by doing

24
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:01,447
calculations on it, or by changing the

25
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:03,796
structure of your dataset. By the end of

26
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,065
this course, you'll have a good

27
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,639
understanding of the core functionality of

28
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:09,144
a Pandas DataFrame, and you'll be able to

29
00:01:09,144 --> 00:01:11,065
handle most everyday tasks. Before

30
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:13,476
beginning the course, you should be

31
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:16,000
familiar with the very basics of Python

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,342
and data science. I hope you'll join me on

33
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:19,812
this journey to learn how to manipulate

34
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:22,909
your data with Pandas with the Pandas

35
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:30,000
