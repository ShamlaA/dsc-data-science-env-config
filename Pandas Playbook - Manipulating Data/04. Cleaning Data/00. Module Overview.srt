00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,061
Hi, in this module we're going to take a

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:07,011
look at the common ways to clean up your

3
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:10,101
dataset. When you start working with a new

4
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:12,394
dataset, usually there are some steps you

5
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:14,832
want to take to tidy up. In this module, I

6
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:17,131
will go over some of the more common

7
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,333
scenarios and how to tackle them. To

8
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,571
start, we will see how to investigate

9
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:23,690
missing data, also called null values, and

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,057
we'll see how to detect these values and

11
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:28,614
take a closer look at them, how to remove

12
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:31,231
them, and how to replace them with other

13
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,626
values either by replacing all missing

14
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:36,695
values with a filler, or by interpolating

15
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:39,778
them from surrounding data. You might also

16
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:42,390
have some other unwanted data in your

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,652
dataset like outliers, or data that occurs

18
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:46,937
more than once, and of course we'll see

19
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:49,254
how to handle these as well. And we'll see

20
00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:51,308
how to fix values that don't have the

21
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:53,460
correct data type, and finally, we'll take

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,000
a look at tidying up the index of your DataFrame.
